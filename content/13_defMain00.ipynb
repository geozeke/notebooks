    "Writing code this way allows you to create a program that is *both* a standalone program and an importable module.  Let's say you're developing the `factorial(n)` function and you've debugged it and got it working well; and let's assume you name the file above `myGreatFactorial.py`.  You can now ship this file to someone else and she can put it in a folder with another Python file and import it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import factorial`\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if it's imported using this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from functions import *`\n",
    "\n",
    "it's okay, because lines 12 and 13 in the code above ensure that `main()` will only be called if `myGreatFactorial.py` is being run directly in Python and will not be called if `myGreatFactorial.py` is imported as a module in another Python program.  You didn't have to comment-out or remove your testing code when you shipped your factorial function.  You've written one program that can be used, unmodified, in multiple ways - very efficient!"
