    "Python [lists](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq) are like arrays in other languages. In Python, lists can either be homogeneous (every item in the list is the same type) or heterogeneous (a collection of different types), which makes them very powerful. For example, this is a perfectly legal list in Python: `[\"Hello\", 0, 3.141]`. Lists are **iterable**, **mutable** and **ordered** (review these definitions here: [02_operations01.ipynb](./02_operations01.ipynb)).  Duplicates are allowed in lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Like any other programming language, there are many ways to approach problems in Python.  Two completely different approaches may be equally valid.  Keep in mind that as you go through these examples you'll often see multiple ways of doing the same thing.  No particular approach is presented here as \"the best\" or \"the only\" way do do things.  Find your own unique programming style and embrace it!*\n",
