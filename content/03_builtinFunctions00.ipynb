    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a modern software design method that scales from small programs to large enterprise systems, with widely distributed teams working in collaboration to build functionality. While this is not a course on OOP, and most of our programs won't be designed using OOP, it's important to know some key terminology. If you've got a little time, you can learn [Object-oriented Programming in 7 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTB0EiLXUC8). Well, at least you can get a good overview and learn some important terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, Python is an Objected Oriented Programming Language. To really unleash the power of Python, you'll make use of its OOP features. For now, let's start with two key terms: *Objects* and *Methods*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An *Object* is like a container that holds not only the data itself, but all the functions that can operate on the data.\n",
    "- OOP designers call the functions that operate on the data *Methods*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's so much more to OOP than just that, but it's a great start. As you expand your Python programming skills, many more tenants of OOP design will reveal themselves along the way. For now, let's just focus on *Objects* and *Methods*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You haven't thought this way yet, but just about any variable you create in Python is actually an *Object*. String variables that you create are more appropriately referred-to as *[Objects of the String Class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq)*, and they bring with them a collection of *Methods* that allow you to do a lot of powerful things to strings. We invoke (call) an *Object's* *Method* by using \"dot\" notation (just like using a function from an imported module).\n",
