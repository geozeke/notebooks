    "What we need is an operator that performs like a [conjunction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPoBE-E8VOc) in English grammar to join Boolean expressions together. Python provides these [logical operators](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#not) for us. Here are the ones you'll use most often:\n",
