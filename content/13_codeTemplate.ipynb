    "* Assignment\n",
    "* Date\n",
    "* Dependencies: If this file requires importing other code files (modules) list them here.\n",

    "The rest of the template may be adjusted or omitted as necessary, depending on the structure of your program. Make liberal use of in-line comments throughout your code to describe its function. Also make effective use of spacing and separators to give your code a clean, consistent, easy-to-read look.\n",
