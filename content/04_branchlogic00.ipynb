    "# Branch Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The term branch logic is a fancy way of saying: *Based on some condition, make a decision about what to do next.* You do this every day. You take input, analyze it, and make decisions about what to do next. With a few simple techniques we can program a computer to make these kinds of decisions as well.\n",

    "### Boolean Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Boolean Data Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) is one that has two possible values: `True` or `False`. In Python, we use the reserved words `True` and `False` for these values. A reserved word in Python means that it's reserved for Python's use, so you cannot have a variable with the name `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few other points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Boolean values for `True` and `False` are written without quotation marks (they're not strings)\n",
    "* The words are [case-sensitive](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/casesens.htm), meaning the character case is specific. `True` is not the same as `true`.\n",
    "* In many other computer languages, `True` is represented by the integer `1`, and `False` is represented by the integer `0`. In the C programming language, the integer `0` represents `False` and any other number (including floats and negative numbers) represents `True`.\n",
    "\n",

    "### What If You Want To Make A Decision With More Than Two Branches?\n",
    "\n",
    "With an `if`-`else` statement, you can think of its execution as a binary choice. Do *this* or *that*. It's a great start, but very often your program logic requires decisions that flow like this: *If something is true, then do this; else if this other thing is true, then do that; else if this other thing is true, then do that.....etc., etc.* What we need is a compound statement that allows for multiple branches in our logic, like this:\n",
