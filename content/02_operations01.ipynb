    "considered a \"Collection Class\", meaning they are a collection of other data\n",
    "types. A String is an array of [bytes](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)\n",
    "representing [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) characters.\n",
    "Python does not have a character data type, so a single character is simply a\n",
    "string with a length of 1.  Strings are iterable, immutable and ordered.\n",
