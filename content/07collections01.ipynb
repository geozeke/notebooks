    "Python [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tut-dictionaries) are incredibly powerful structures composed of a collection of key-value pairs. Keys in dictionaries can be any **immutable** type; for example, strings and numbers can always be keys. A dictionary in Python works in a similar way to a dictionary in a real world.  Dictionaries are **iterable**, **mutable** and **unordered**.  Duplicate *keys* are not allowed in dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are examples of some common design patterns using dictionaries. Let's start with creating a dictionary and adding / accessing *key:value* pairs.  Let's assume we're using strings for both keys and values in our dictionary. Take note of the syntax below for adding a *key:value* pair to a dictionary.  It looks a lot like the syntax for accessing items in a list."

Python allows you to extract the keys from a dictionary object using the [keys()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping) method, which returns a *dict_keys* object. You can then cast the *dict_keys* object into a list, using the [list()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping) function.  From there you can sort it and iterate across it."

    "* If you assign a value to a dictionary key, and the key is not in the dictionary, Python will add the new *key:value* pair to the dictionary.  If the key does exist in the dictionary, Python will replace the current value assigned to the given key with the new value.\n",
    "* You can use the `len()` function on dictionaries to get the number of entries.\n",
    "* You can't copy a dictionary simply by typing `D1 = D2`.  Dictionaries are objects, and the variables we use for them are pointers.  If you use `D1 = D2`, then `D1` and `D2` will point to the *same* dictionary.  You can use the `copy()` method for dictionaries instead.\n",
    "* The `copy()` method performs what's known as a *shallow* copy and works as expected when the values in your dictionary are simple, immutable data types.  If your dictionary contains objects as values, then you must perform a *deep* copy using the `deepcopy()` method.  This applies to sets and lists as well. See the Additional Resources section below for more information."
