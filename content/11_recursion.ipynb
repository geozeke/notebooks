Since we are running it directly, line 13 executes a call to the `main()` function. Python then builds what's called a *Stack Frame* that contains all the information needed to continue execution at line 14, at a later time, and transfers control to the `main()` function. The `main()` function then runs until it performs its return (line 10).\n",

The `sumInts()` function runs until it performs its return (line 5). Control then transfers back, one *Stack Frame* at a time until the program is complete.\n",

    "This collection of *Stack Frames* is known as the *Call Stack*. Think of it like a stack of plates, where the one on top is the only one that's running, and all the plates below are waiting for their turn. The plates are arranged in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order and the picture looks something like this (start at the bottom right):\n",

Just like in the example above, every time a function is called, even if it's calling itself, another *Frame* is generated on the *Call Stack*. Below is the same program written recursively. Try it with a few integers below 1,000; then try 10,000. What happens?"
