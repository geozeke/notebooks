    "Moving data between our program and our users using the terminal is helpful, but has limitations. If you're writing a program to perform analysis on some large data set it may not be practical to key the data by-hand each time you run the program. You may also want to write a program that generates data for use in another application. Again, working with large data sets in this scenario becomes problematic if you can only move data in and out of your program using [input()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) and [print()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).\n",

    "Like most programming languages, Python provides the tools to read and write data using a file that's separate from the file containing our code. There's a good overview of [file I/O available in the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html). In this notebook we'll explore the basic operations necessary to perform input and output on text files; files that can be opened and examined with any text editor. While Python does provide the tools for operating on *binary* files, we'll save that topic for a later course. For now, just think of a data file as multiple lines of text, like this:\n",

    "Using Jupyter Notebooks to explore file I/O in Python requires a little trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open (create) a file within a Python program, the file usually resides in the same directory as your program. We don't want to start creating extraneous files in our Jupyter notebooks directory for any sample programs we work with, so for programs in this notebook we have to create our files somewhere else. Putting them on your Linux desktop is a good choice. You'll be able to easily find them and delete them after you're done exploring this notebook. Luckily for us, Linux treats your desktop as just another directory. The `Desktop` directory is located in your home directory, and for me it's: `/home/nardi/Desktop`. If I write a program and specify that I want to create a new file (let's say `test1.txt`), and I want to put that file on my desktop, I would create this file: `/home/nardi/Desktop/test1.txt`.\n",

    "### How Does a Python Program Access Files?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we open a file in Python we create a link between the file on the disk and a variable our program can use to refer to the file. This variable is called a *file descriptor*. The act of opening a file creates this link. Once we connect a file on the disk with a *file descriptor*, we use the *file descriptor* throughout our program to read and write to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a file descriptor using Python's [open()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) command. Click on the link for the [open()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) command and examine the documentation. You'll see a listing of seven different *modes* for opening a file. In this course, we'll explore just three: read (`'r'`); write (`'w'`) and append (`'a'`). *Note: The single quotation marks around each letter are part of the syntax.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the rules for our three *modes* (no need to memorize these, just practice them and they'll become second nature):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `'r'`: If the file exists, open it and go to the beginning of the file and start reading. If the file doesn't exist, opening it with `'r'` mode will throw an exception (cause an error).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `'w'`: If the file exists, open it and go to the ***beginning*** of the file. Any content you write to the file will ***overwrite*** what's already there. If the file doesn't exist, then `'w'` will create it; open it; and start writing to it from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `'a'`: If the file exists, open it and go to the ***end*** of the file. Any new content you write to the file will ***be appended*** to what's already there. If the file doesn't exist, then `'a'` will create it; open it; and start writing to it from the end (which is the same as the beginning for an empty file).\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for using the [open()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) command shown in the documentation can look a little confusing. Here it is in its simplified form:\n",
