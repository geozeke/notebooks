    "#### 1. Make exceptions specific\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we're dealing with one specific exception `ValueError`.  Recall that Python's [input()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) function always returns a string type and if we try to cast the string \"42\" to an int, it works fine.  If we try to cast the string \"Navy\" to an int, a `ValueError` exception is raised.  If we left the `ValueError` qualifier off our `except` clause, the code would still work, however we wouldn't able to determine exactly what caused the error or take specific actions based on specific errors.  To cover multiple exceptions, Python allows you to chain multiple `except` clauses within a single `try...except`.  Run the example below for a demonstration."
