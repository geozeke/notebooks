    "# Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "A [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq) is an immutable sequence type of Python objects. They're frequently used when you want to return more than one value from a function. Python tuples can be heterogeneous, which makes them very powerful. For example, this is a perfectly legal tuple in Python: `(\"Hello\", 0, 3.141)`. Tuples are **iterable**, **immutable** and **ordered**.  Duplicates are allowed in tuples.\n",
