    "As a quick review from your Plebe Cyber Course, hash functions are one-way functions with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Easy (for a computer) to compute the hash for a string\n",
    "2. Hard (takes way too long) to start with a hash value and construct a string that hashes to it\n",
    "3. Impossible to start with a string and find a different string that hashes to the same value -- ideal hash functions produce unique keys\n",

    "Python's hashing library is quite powerful.  To hash a string in Python requires four basic steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the algorithm (digest) to use for hashing\n",
    "2. Encode the string as a series of bytes\n",
    "3. Hash the encoded string\n",

    "You can display the algorithms available on your system using the `algorithms_available` constant attribute.  This constant lists all the algorithms available in your system, including the ones available in the Python distribution as well as those in the `OpenSSl` package.  To use a hashing function, start by importing the [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) module within your code."
