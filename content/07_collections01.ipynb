    "Python [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tut-dictionaries) are incredibly powerful structures composed of a collection of key-value pairs. Keys in dictionaries can be any **immutable** type; for example, strings and numbers can always be keys. A dictionary in Python works in a similar way to a dictionary in the real world.  Dictionaries are **iterable**, **mutable** and **unordered**.  Duplicate *keys* are not allowed in dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are examples of some common design patterns using dictionaries. Let's start by creating a dictionary and add / access *key:value* pairs.  Let's assume we're using strings for both keys and values in our dictionary. Take note of the syntax below for adding a *key:value* pair to a dictionary.  It looks a lot like the syntax for accessing items in a list."

    "* You can use the [len()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) function on dictionaries to get the number of entries.\n",
    "* You can't copy a dictionary simply by typing `D1 = D2`, because the variables we use for them are pointers.  If you use `D1 = D2`, then `D1` and `D2` will point to the *same* dictionary. You must use the [copy()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html) method for dictionaries instead.\n",
    "* The [copy()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html) method performs what's known as a *shallow* copy and works as expected when the values in your dictionary are simple, immutable data types.  If your dictionary contains objects as values, then you must perform a *deep* copy using the [deepcopy()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html) method.  This applies to sets and lists as well. See the Additional Resources section below for more information."
