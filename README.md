# Introduction to Python Using Jupyter Notebooks

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for teaching Python programming with an emphasis on the fundamentals of Cyber Operations.  It's not meant to be a complete Python textbook, but rather an organized reference guide to allow you to see interactive examples on specific Python topics.

## Topics

1.    Introduction
      * Using Jupyter Notebooks
      * Your first Python program
    
    
2.    Basic operations
      * Variables, assignment statements, expressions
      * Reading console input
      * Numeric data types
      * Operator precedence
      * Strings
      * Type conversions
   
   
3.    Built-in Functions and Objects
      * Common functions
      * Objects and methods
      * Formatting output with `.format()`
   
   
4.    Branch Logic
      * Boolean data types
      * `if` statements
      * `if` - `else` statements
      * `if` - `elif` - `else` statements
      * Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
      * Operator precedence
   
   
5.    Iteration (Loops)
      * `for` loop
      * `while` loop
      * Nested loops
      * `break` and `continue`
   

6.    User Defined Functions
      * Introduction
      * Defining functions
      * Calling functions

7.    Collections: Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples
      * Creating
      * Accessing data
      * Functions - returning multiple values
      * Functions - pass by value; pass by reference

   
8.    File I/O
      * Modes: read (`'r'`), write (`'w'`), append(`'a'`)
      * Writing and closing: `write()`, `close()`
      * Ways to read: `read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`
      

9.    Hashing
      * Hashing strings
