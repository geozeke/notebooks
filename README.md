# Introduction to Python using Jupyter Notebooks

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for teaching Python programming with an emphasis on the fundamentals of Cyber Operations.  It's not meant to be a complete Python textbook, but rather an organized reference guide to allow you to see interactive examples on specific Python topics.
