# Introduction to Python Using Jupyter Notebooks

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for teaching Python programming with an emphasis on the fundamentals of Cyber Operations.  It's not meant to be a complete Python textbook, but rather an organized reference guide to allow you to see interactive examples on specific Python topics.

   * Your First Python Program
    
    
2. Basic operations
   * Variables, Assignment Statements, Expressions
   * Reading console input
   * Numeric Data Types
   * Operator Precedence
   * Strings
   * Type Conversions
   
   
3. Built-in Functions and Objects
   * Common Functions
   * Objects and Methods
   * Formatting output with `.format()`
   
   
4. Branch Logic
   * Boolean Data Types
   * `if` Statements
   * `if` - `else` Statements
   * `if` - `elif` - `else` Statements
