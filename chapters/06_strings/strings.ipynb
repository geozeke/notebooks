    "\n",
    "* *Lists* are like arrays in other languages. Python lists can be heterogeneous, which makes them very powerful. For example, this is a perfectly legal list in Python: <br>`[\"Hello\", 0, 3.141]`. Lists are **iterable**, **mutable** and **ordered**.  Duplicates are allowed in lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Dictionaries* are collections of key-value pairs. Keys in dictionaries can be any **immutable** type; for example, strings and numbers can always be keys. A Dictionary in Python works in a similar way to a Dictionary in a real world.  Dictionaries are **iterable**, **mutable** and **unordered**.  Duplicate *keys* are not allowed in dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Sets* in Python are equivalent to sets in mathematics. Python sets can be heterogeneous, which makes them very powerful. For example, this is a perfectly legal set in Python: <br>`{\"Hello\", 0, 3.141}`. Sets are **iterable**, **mutable** and **unordered**.  Duplicates are not allowed in sets (this actually makes them really useful, as we'll see later).\n",

Keep in mind that as you go through these examples you'll often see multiple ways of doing the same thing.  No particular approach is presented here as \"the best\" or \"the only\" way do do things.  Find your own unique programming style and embrace it!*"
